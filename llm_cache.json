Even though there are a lot of great online chess games available, such as [lichess](https://lichess.org/) and [chess.com](https://chess.com/), I've never felt the same sense of connection to the real tactile chess game.\n\nI started a project to combine a strong chess engine with a hardware chess board in order to solve this. My goal was to develop a chess engine that could easily interface with any hardware configuration, bringing the excitement of playing against a highly intelligent artificial intelligence to a physical chess board, while utilising the flexibility and efficiency of the Rust programming language.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThis particular AI works using the [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), along with [Alpha-Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) for optimization.\n\nNow, let's unpack that.\n\nThe Minimax algorithm essentially iterates through all possible moves recursively, and assumes that whenever the computer plays, the human player will always respond with the best move.\n\n![Move generation](/assets/move-generation.png)\n\nThis allows the computer to almost always play objectively better moves than the player.\n\n![Minimax](/assets/mini-max.jpeg)\n\nAs you can see with a little experimentation, it works quite well. \n\n\n### Abusing Minimax\n\nBecause Minimax works by simply maximizing the AI's material advantage over the player, it's incredibly simple to abuse the algorithm by changing what it is maximizing.\n\nHere, for example, is the **_opposite_** of a good AI. This AI tries to maximize _**YOUR**_ material value, and will desperately try to offer you its pieces while still making legal moves.\n\n\n## Integration with Hardware Chess Board\n\nNow, let's talk about the exciting part – integrating this powerful chess engine with a hardware chess board. Imagine being able to play against a formidable AI opponent while physically interacting with a traditional chess board.\n\nThrough the use of sensors and actuators, the hardware chess board can communicate with the chess engine, translating physical moves into digital commands and vice versa. This seamless integration brings the best of both worlds, combining the tangible experience of moving chess pieces with the strategic depth of a sophisticated AI opponent.\n\n": "Here is a summary of the project's purpose and key features in 2-3 sentences:\n\nThe Chess Engine project aims to combine the classic beauty of a physical chess board with the computational power of AI, creating a seamless experience where players can interact with a traditional chess board while playing against a highly intelligent artificial intelligence.

  "Summarize the following GitHub repository README content in 2-3 sentences, focusing on the project's purpose and key features:\n\nMy solutions to Eudyptula challenges.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n\r\nThis is Task 01 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWrite a Linux kernel module, and stand-alone Makefile, that when loaded\r\nprints to the kernel debug log level, \"Hello World!\"  Be sure to make\r\nthe module be able to be unloaded as well.\r\n\r\nThe Makefile should build the kernel module against the source for the\r\ncurrently running kernel, or, use an environment variable to specify\r\nwhat kernel tree to build it against.\r\n\r\nPlease show proof of this module being built, and running, in your\r\nkernel.  What this proof is is up to you, I'm sure you can come up with\r\nsomething.  Also be sure to send the kernel module you wrote, along with\r\nthe Makefile you created to build the module.\r\n\r\nRemember to use your ID assigned to you in the Subject: line when\r\nresponding to this task, so that I can figure out who to attribute it\r\nto.  You can just respond to the task with the answers and all should be\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nIf you forgot, your id is \"7c1caf2f50d1\".  But of course you have not\r\nforgotten that yet, you are better than that.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 02 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow that you have written your first kernel module, it's time to take\r\noff the training wheels and move on to building a custom kernel.  No\r\nmore distro kernels for you, for this task you must run your own kernel.\r\nAnd use git!  Exciting isn't it!  No, oh, ok...\r\n\r\nThe tasks for this round is:\r\n  - download Linus's latest git tree from git.kernel.org (you have to\r\n    figure out which one is his, it's not that hard, just remember what\r\n    his last name is and you should be fine.)\r\n  - build it, install it, and boot it.  You can use whatever kernel\r\n    configuration options you wish to use, but you must enable\r\n    CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO=y.\r\n  - show proof of booting this kernel.  Bonus points for you if you do\r\n    it on a \"real\" machine, and not a virtual machine (virtual machines\r\n    are acceptable, but come on, real kernel developers don't mess\r\n    around with virtual machines, they are too slow.  Oh yeah, we aren't\r\n    real kernel developers just yet.  Well, I'm not anyway, I'm just a\r\n    script...)  Again, proof of running this kernel is up to you, I'm\r\n    sure you can do well.\r\n\r\nHint, you should look into the 'make localmodconfig' option, and base\r\nyour kernel configuration on a working distro kernel configuration.\r\nDon't sit there and answer all 1625 different kernel configuration\r\noptions by hand, even I, a foolish script, know better than to do that!\r\n\r\nAfter doing this, don't throw away that kernel and git tree and\r\nconfiguration file.  You'll be using it for later tasks, a working\r\nkernel configuration file is a precious thing, all kernel developers\r\nhave one they have grown and tended to over the years.  This is the\r\nstart of a long journey with yours, don't discard it like was a broken\r\numbrella, it deserves better than that.\r\n\r\nRemember to use your ID assigned to you in the Subject: line when\r\nresponding to this task, so that I can figure out who to attribute it\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIf you forgot, your id is \"7c1caf2f50d1\".  But why do I repeat myself?\r\nOf course you know your id, you made it through the first task just fine\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 03 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow that you have your custom kernel up and running, it's time to modify\r\nit!\r\n\r\nThe tasks for this round is:\r\n  - take the kernel git tree from Task 02 and modify the Makefile to\r\n    and modify the EXTRAVERSION field.  Do this in a way that the\r\n    running kernel (after modifying the Makefile, rebuilding, and\r\n    rebooting) has the characters \"-eudyptula\" in the version string.\r\n  - show proof of booting this kernel.  Extra cookies for you by\r\n    providing creative examples, especially if done in intrepretive\r\n    dance at your local pub.\r\n  - Send a patch that shows the Makefile modified.  Do this in a manner\r\n    that would be acceptable for merging in the kernel source tree.\r\n    (Hint, read the file Documentation/SubmittingPatches and follow the\r\n    steps there.)\r\n\r\nRemember to use your ID assigned to you in the Subject: line when\r\nresponding to this task, so that I can figure out who to attribute it\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIf you forgot, your id is \"7c1caf2f50d1\".  Surely I don't need to keep\r\nsaying this right?  I know, _you_ wouldn't forget, but someone else, of\r\ncourse they would, so I'll just leave it here for those \"others\".\r\n\r\nThis is Task 04 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWonderful job in making it this far, I hope you have been having fun.\r\nOh, you're getting bored, just booting and installing kernels?  Well,\r\ntime for some pedantic things to make you feel that those kernel builds\r\nare actually fun!\r\n\r\nPart of the job of being a kernel developer is recognizing the proper\r\nLinux kernel coding style.  The full description of this coding style\r\ncan be found in the kernel itself, in the Documentation/CodingStyle\r\nfile.  I'd recommend going and reading that right now, it's pretty\r\nsimple stuff, and something that you are going to need to know and\r\nunderstand.  There is also a tool in the kernel source tree in the\r\nscripts/ directory called checkpatch.pl that can be used to test for\r\nadhering to the coding style rules, as kernel programmers are lazy and\r\nprefer to let scripts do their work for them...\r\n\r\nAnd why a coding standard at all?  That's because of your brain (yes,\r\nyours, not mine, remember, I'm just some dumb shell scripts).  Once your\r\nbrain learns the patterns, the information contained really starts to\r\nsink in better.  So it's important that everyone follow the same\r\nstandard so that the patterns become consistent.  In other words, you\r\nwant to make it really easy for other people to find the bugs in your\r\ncode, and not be confused and distracted by the fact that you happen to\r\nprefer 5 spaces instead of tabs for indentation.  Of course you would\r\nnever prefer such a thing, I'd never accuse you of that, it was just an\r\nexample, please forgive my impertinence!\r\n\r\nAnyway, the tasks for this round all deal with the Linux kernel coding\r\nstyle.  Attached to this message are two kernel modules that do not\r\nfollow the proper Linux kernel coding style rules.  Please fix both of\r\nthem up, and send it back to me in such a way that does follow the\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nWhat, you recognize one of these modules?  Imagine that, perhaps I was\r\nright to accuse you of the using a \"wrong\" coding style :)\r\n\r\nYes, the logic in the second module is crazy, and probably wrong, but\r\ndon't focus on that, just look at the patterns here, and fix up the\r\ncoding style, do not remove lines of code.\r\n\r\nAs always, please remember to use your ID assigned to you in the\r\nSubject: line when responding to this task, so that I can figure out who\r\nto attribute it to.  And if you forgot (which of course you have not,\r\nwe've been through all of this before), your id is \"7c1caf2f50d1\".\r\n\r\nThis is Task 05 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYeah, you survived the coding style mess!  Now, on to some \"real\"\r\nthings, as I know you are getting bored by these so far.\r\n\r\nSo, simple task this time around:\r\n  - take the kernel module you wrote for task 01, and modify it so that\r\n    when a USB keyboard is plugged in, the module will be automatically\r\n    loaded by the correct userspace hotplug tools (which are implemented\r\n    by depmod / kmod / udev / mdev / systemd, depending on what distro\r\n    you are using.)\r\n\r\nYes, so simple, and yet, it's a bit tricky.  As a hint, go read chapter\r\n14 of the book, \"Linux Device Drivers, 3rd edition.\"  Don't worry, it's\r\nfree, and online, no need to go buy anything.\r\n\r\nAs always, please remember to use your ID assigned to you, yadda yadda\r\nyadda...  It's \"7c1caf2f50d1\" of course.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 06 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNice job with the module loading macros, those are tricky, but a very\r\nvaluable skill to know about, especially when running across them in\r\nreal kernel code.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of real kernel code, let's write some!\r\n\r\nThe task this time is this:\r\n  - Take the kernel module you wrote for task 01, and modify it to be a\r\n    misc char device driver.  The misc interface is a very simple way to\r\n    be able to create a character device, without having to worry about\r\n    all of the sysfs and character device registration mess.  And what a\r\n    mess it is, so stick to the simple interfaces wherever possible.\r\n  - The misc device should be created with a dynamic minor number, no\r\n    need running off and trying to reserve a real minor number for your\r\n    test module, that would be crazy.\r\n  - The misc device should implement the read and write functions.\r\n  - The misc device node should show up in /dev/eudyptula.\r\n  - When the character device node is read from, your assigned id is\r\n    returned to the caller.\r\n  - When the character device node is written to, the data sent to the\r\n    kernel needs to be checked.  If it matches your assigned id, then\r\n    return a correct write return value.  If the value does not match\r\n    your assigned id, return the \"invalid value\" error value.\r\n  - The misc device should be registered when your module is loaded, and\r\n    unregistered when it is unloaded.\r\n  - Provide some \"proof\" this all works properly.\r\n\r\nAs you will be putting your id into the kernel module, of course you\r\nhaven't forgotten it, but just to be safe, it's \"7c1caf2f50d1\".\r\n\r\nThis is Task 07 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGreat work with that misc device driver.  Isn't that a nice and simple\r\nway to write a character driver?\r\n\r\nJust when you think this challenge is all about writing kernel code,\r\nthis task is a throwback to your second one.  Yes, that's right,\r\nbuilding kernels.  Turns out that's what most developers end up doing,\r\ntons and tons of rebuilds, not writing new code.  Sad, but it is a good\r\nskill to know.\r\n\r\nThe tasks this round are:\r\n  - Download the linux-next kernel for today.  Or tomorrow, just use\r\n    the latest one.  It changes every day so there is no specific one\r\n    you need to pick.  Build it.  Boot it.  Provide proof that you built\r\n    and booted it.\r\n\r\nWhat is the linux-next kernel?  Ah, that's part of the challenge.\r\n\r\nFor a hint, you should read the excellent documentation about how the\r\nLinux kernel is developed in Documentation/development-process/ in the\r\nkernel source itself.  It's a great read, and should tell you all you\r\nnever wanted to know about what Linux kernel developers do and how they\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nAs always, please respond to this challenge with your id.  I know you\r\nknow what it is.  I'll not even include it this time, I trust you.\r\nDon't make me feel that is a mistake.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 08 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe will come back to the linux-next kernel in a later exercise, so don't\r\ngo and delete that directory, you'll want it around.  But enough of\r\nbuilding kernels, let's write more code!\r\n\r\nThis task is much like the 06 task with the misc device, but this time\r\nwe are going to focus on another user/kernel interface, debugfs.  It is\r\nrumored that the creator of debugfs said that there is only one rule for\r\ndebugfs use, \"There are no rules when using debugfs.\"  So let's take\r\nthem up on that offer and see how to use it.\r\n\r\ndebugfs should be mounted by your distro in /sys/kernel/debug/, if it\r\nisn't, then you can mount it with the line:\r\n        mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/\r\n\r\nMake sure it is enabled in your kernel, with the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS option,\r\nyou will need it for this task.\r\n\r\nThe task, in specifics is:\r\n\r\n  - Take the kernel module you wrote for task 01, and modify it to be\r\n    create a debugfs subdirectory called \"eudyptula\".  In that\r\n    directory, create 3 virtual files called \"id\", \"jiffies\", and \"foo\".\r\n  - The file \"id\" operates just like it did for example 06, use the same\r\n    logic there, the file must be readable and writable by any user.\r\n  - The file \"jiffies\" is to be read only by any user, and when read,\r\n    should return the current value of the jiffies kernel timer.\r\n  - The file \"foo\" needs to be writable only by root, but readable by\r\n    anyone.  When writing to it, the value must be stored, up to one\r\n    page of data.  When read, which can be done by any user, the value\r\n    must be returned that is stored it it.  Properly handle the fact\r\n    that someone could be reading from the file while someone else is\r\n    writing to it (oh, a locking hint!)\r\n  - When the module is unloaded, all of the debugfs files are cleaned\r\n    up, and any memory allocated is freed.\r\n  - Provide some \"proof\" this all works.\r\n\r\nAgain, you are using your id in the code, so you know what it is by now,\r\nno need to repeat it again.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 09 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNice job with debugfs, that is a handy thing to remember when wanting to\r\nprint out some debugging information.  Never use /proc/ that is only for\r\nprocesses, use debugfs instead.\r\n\r\nAlong with debugfs, sysfs is a common place to put information that\r\nneeds to move from the user to the kernel.  So let us focus on sysfs for\r\nthis task.\r\n\r\nThe task this time:\r\n\r\n  - Take the code you wrote in task 08, and move it to sysfs.  Put the\r\n    \"eudyptula\" directory under the /sys/kernel/ location in sysfs.\r\n  - Provide some \"proof\" this works.\r\n\r\nThat's it!  Simple, right?  No, you are right, it's more complex, sysfs\r\nis complicated.  I'd recommend reading Documentation/kobject.txt as a\r\nprimer on how to use kobjects and sysfs.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask for hints and help with this one if you have questions\r\nby sending in code to review if you get stuck, many people have dropped\r\nout in the challenge at this point in time, so don't feel bad about\r\nasking, we don't want to see you go away just because sysfs is so damn\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 10 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYeah, you conquered the sysfs monster, great job!\r\n\r\nNow you know to never want to mess with a kobject again, right?  Trust\r\nme, there are easier ways to create sysfs files, and we will get into\r\nthat for a future task, but for now, let's make it a bit more simple\r\nafter all of that coding.\r\n\r\nFor this task, go back to the linux-next tree you used for task 07.\r\nUpdate it, and then do the following:\r\n  - Create a patch that fixes one coding style problem in any of the\r\n    files in drivers/staging/\r\n  - Make sure the patch is correct by running it through\r\n    scripts/checkpatch.pl\r\n  - Submit the code to the maintainer of the driver/subsystem, finding\r\n    the proper name and mailing lists to send it to by running the tool,\r\n    scripts/get_maintainer.pl on your patch.\r\n  - Send a web link back to me of your patch on the public mailing list\r\n    archive (don't cc: me on the patch, that will only confuse me and\r\n    everyone in the kernel development community.)\r\n  - If you want to mention the Eudyptula Challenge as the reason for\r\n    writing the patch, feel free to do so in the body of the patch, but\r\n    it's not necessary at all.\r\n\r\nHopefully this patch will be accepted into the kernel tree, and all of a\r\nsudden, you are an \"official\" kernel developer!\r\n\r\nDon't worry, there's plenty more tasks coming, but a little breather\r\nevery now and again for something simple is always nice to have.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 11 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou made a successful patch to the kernel source tree, that's a great\r\nstep!\r\n\r\nBut, let's not rest, time to get back to code.\r\n\r\nRemember that mess of kobject and sysfs code back in task 09?  Let's\r\nmove one level up the tree and start to mess with devices and not raw\r\nkobjects.\r\n\r\nFor this task:\r\n  - Write a patch against any driver that you are currently using on\r\n    your machine.  So first you have to figure out which drivers you are\r\n    using, and where the source code in the kernel tree is for that\r\n    driver.\r\n  - In that driver, add a sysfs file to show up in the /sys/devices/\r\n    tree for the device that is called \"id\".  As you might expect, this\r\n    file follows the same rules as task 09 as for what you can read and\r\n    write to it.\r\n  - The file is to show up only for devices that are controlled by a\r\n    single driver, not for all devices of a single type (like all USB\r\n    devices.  But all USB maibox LEDs would be acceptable, if you happen\r\n    to have the device that that driver controls.)\r\n\r\nSubmit both the patch, in proper kernel commit form, and \"proof\" of it\r\nworking properly on your machine.\r\n\r\nAnd as always, please use your id in the subject line.  If you happened\r\nto forget it, as it has been a while since I reminded you of it, it is\r\n\"7c1caf2f50d1\".\r\n\r\nThis is Task 12 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNice job with the driver patch.  That took some work in finding the\r\nproper place to modify, and demonstrates a great skill in tracking down\r\nissues when you can't get a specific piece of hardware working.\r\n\r\nNow let's step back from drivers (they are boring things), and focus on\r\nthe kernel core.  To do that, we need to go way back to the basics --\r\nstuff you would learn in your \"intro to data structures\" class, if you\r\nhappened to take one.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm talking about linked lists.\r\n\r\nThe kernel has a unique way of creating and handling linked lists, that\r\nis quite different than the \"textbook\" way of doing so.  But, it turns\r\nout to be faster, and simpler, than a \"textbook\" would describe, so\r\nthat's a good thing.\r\n\r\nFor this task, write a kernel module, based on your cleaned up one from\r\ntask 04, that does the following:\r\n  - You have a structure that has 3 fields:\r\n        char  name[20];\r\n        int   id;\r\n        bool  busy;\r\n    name this structure \"identity\".\r\n  - Your module has a static variable that points to a list of these\r\n    \"identity\" structures.\r\n  - Write a function that looks like:\r\n        int identity_create(char *name, int id)\r\n    that creates the structure \"identity\", copies in the 'name' and 'id'\r\n    fields and sets 'busy' to false.  Proper error checking for out of\r\n    memory issues is required.  Return 0 if everything went ok; an error\r\n    value if something went wrong.\r\n  - Write a function that looks like:\r\n        struct identity *identity_find(int id);\r\n    that takes a given id, iterates over the list of all ids, and\r\n    returns the proper 'struct identity' associated with it.  If the\r\n    identity is not found, return NULL.\r\n  - Write a function that looks like:\r\n        void identity_destroy(int id);\r\n    that given an id, finds the proper 'struct identity' and removes it\r\n    from the system.\r\n  - Your module_init() function will look much like the following:\r\n\r\n        struct identity *temp;\r\n\r\n        identity_create(\"Alice\", 1);\r\n        identity_create(\"Bob\", 2);\r\n        identity_create(\"Dave\", 3);\r\n        identity_create(\"Gena\", 10);\r\n\r\n        temp = identity_find(3);\r\n        pr_debug(\"id 3 = %s\\n\", temp->name);\r\n\r\n        temp = identity_find(42);\r\n        if (temp == NULL)\r\n                pr_debug(\"id 42 not found\\n\");\r\n\r\n        identity_destroy(2);\r\n        identity_destroy(1);\r\n        identity_destroy(10);\r\n        identity_destroy(42);\r\n        identity_destroy(3);\r\n\r\n   Bonus points for properly checking return values of the above\r\n   functions.\r\n\r\nAs always, please send the full module (following the proper kernel\r\ncoding style rules), and \"proof\" of it working properly.  And remember\r\nto use your id of \"7c1caf2f50d1\" in the Subject line properly.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 13 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWeren't those lists fun to play with?  You should get used to them, they\r\nare used all over the kernel in lots of different places.\r\n\r\nNow that we are allocating a structure that we want to use a lot of, we\r\nmight want to start caring about the speed of the allocation, and not\r\nhave to worry about the creation of those objects from the \"general\"\r\nmemory pools of the kernel.\r\n\r\nThis task is to take the code written in task 12, and cause all memory\r\nallocated from the 'struct identity' to come from a private slab cache\r\njust for the fun of it.\r\n\r\nInstead of using kmalloc() and kfree() in the module, use\r\nkmem_cache_alloc() and kmem_cache_free() instead.  Of course this means\r\nyou will have to initialize your memory cache properly when the module\r\nstarts up.  Don't forget to do that.  You are free to name your memory\r\ncache whatever you wish, but it should show up in the /proc/slabinfo\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nDon't send the full module for this task, only a patch with the diff\r\nfrom task 12 showing the lines changed.  This means you will have to\r\nkeep a copy of your 12 task results somewhere to make sure you don't\r\noverwrite them.\r\n\r\nAlso show the output of /proc/slabinfo with your module loaded.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 14 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow that you have the basics of lists, and we glossed over the custom\r\nallocators (the first cut at that task was much harder, you got off\r\neasy), it's time to move on to something a bit more old-school: tasks.\r\n\r\nFor this task:\r\n  - Add a new field to the core kernel task structure called, wait for\r\n    it, \"id\".\r\n  - When the task is created, set the id to your id.  Imaginative, I\r\n    know.  You try writing these tasks.\r\n  - Add a new proc file for every task called, \"id\", located in the\r\n    /proc/${PID}/ directory for that task.\r\n  - When the proc file is read from, have it print out the value of\r\n    your id, and then increment it by one, allowing different tasks to\r\n    have different values for the \"id\" file over time as they are read\r\n    from.\r\n  - Provide some \"proof\" it all works properly.\r\n\r\nAs you are touching files all over the kernel tree, a patch is the\r\nrequired result to be sent in here.  Please specify which kernel version\r\nyou make this patch against, to give my virtual machines a chance to\r\nfigure out how to apply it.\r\n\r\nAlso provide some kind of proof that you tested the patch.\r\n\r\nAnd, in case you happened to forget it, your id is \"7c1caf2f50d1\".\r\n\r\nThis is Task 15 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThat process task turned out to not be all that complex, but digging\r\nthrough the core kernel was a tough task, nice work with that.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of \"core kernel\" tasks, let's do another one.  It's one of the\r\nmost common undergraduate tasks there is: create a new syscall!\r\nYeah, loads of fun, but it's good to know the basics of how to do this,\r\nand, how to call it from userspace.\r\n\r\nFor this task:\r\n  - Add a new syscall to the kernel called \"sys_eudyptula\", so this is\r\n    all going to be changes to the kernel tree itself, no stand-alone\r\n    module needed for this task (unless you want to do it that way\r\n    without hacking around the syscall table, if so, bonus points for\r\n    you...)\r\n  - The syscall number needs to be the next syscall number for the\r\n    architecture you test it on (some of you all are doing this on ARM\r\n    systems, showoffs, and syscall numbers are not the same across all\r\n    architectures).  Document the arch you are using and why you picked\r\n    this number in the module.\r\n  - The syscall should take two parameters: int high_id, int low_id.\r\n  - The syscall will take the two values, mush them together into one\r\n    64bit value (low_id being the lower 32bits of the id, high_id being\r\n    the upper 32bits of the id).\r\n  - If the id value matches your id (which of course you know as\r\n    \"7c1caf2f50d1\", then the syscall returns success.  Otherwise it\r\n    returns a return code signifying an invalid value was passed to it.\r\n  - Write a userspace C program that calls the syscall and properly\r\n    exercises it (valid and invalid calls need to be made).\r\n  - \"Proof\" of running the code needs to be provided.\r\n\r\nSo you need to send in a .c userspace program, a kernel patch, and\r\n\"proof\" that it all works, as a response.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 16 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGood job with the new syscall.  The odds of you ever having to write a\r\nnew syscall is pretty rare, but now you know where to look them up, and\r\nwhat the code involved in creating one looks like, which is useful when\r\nyou try to debug things.\r\n\r\nLet's take a breather after all of that code, and go back to doing a bit\r\nof reading, and learn some more about some common kernel tools.\r\n\r\nGo install the tool 'sparse'.  It was started by Linus as a\r\nstatic-analysis tool that acts much like a compiler.  The kernel build\r\nsystem is set up to have it run if you ask it to, and it will report a\r\nbunch of issues in C code that are really specific to the kernel.\r\n\r\nWhen you build the kernel, pass the \"C=1\" option to the build, to have\r\nsparse run on the .c file before gcc is run.  Depending on the file,\r\nnothing might be printed out, or something might.  Here's an example of\r\nit being run on the ext4 code:\r\n\r\n$ make C=1 M=fs/ext4\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/balloc.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/balloc.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/bitmap.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/bitmap.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/dir.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/dir.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/file.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/file.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/fsync.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/fsync.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/ialloc.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/ialloc.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/inode.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/inode.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/page-io.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/page-io.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/ioctl.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/ioctl.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/namei.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/namei.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/super.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/super.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/symlink.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/symlink.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/hash.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/hash.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/resize.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/resize.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/extents.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/extents.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/ext4_jbd2.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/ext4_jbd2.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/migrate.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/migrate.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/mballoc.c\r\nfs/ext4/mballoc.c:5018:9: warning: context imbalance in 'ext4_trim_extent' - unexpected unlock\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/mballoc.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/block_validity.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/block_validity.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/move_extent.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/move_extent.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/mmp.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/mmp.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/indirect.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/indirect.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/extents_status.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/extents_status.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/xattr.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/xattr.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/xattr_user.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/xattr_user.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/xattr_trusted.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/xattr_trusted.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/inline.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/inline.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/acl.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/acl.o\r\n  CHECK   fs/ext4/xattr_security.c\r\n  CC      fs/ext4/xattr_security.o\r\n  LD      fs/ext4/ext4.o\r\n  LD      fs/ext4/built-in.o\r\n  Building modules, stage 2.\r\n  MODPOST 0 modules\r\n\r\nAs you can see, only one warning was found here, and odds are, it is a\r\nfalse-positive, as I'm sure those ext4 developers know what they are\r\ndoing with their locking functions, right?\r\n\r\nAnyway the task this time is:\r\n  - Run sparse on the drivers/staging/ directory, yes, that horrible\r\n    code again, sorry.\r\n  - Find one warning that looks interesting.\r\n  - Write a patch that resolves the issue.\r\n  - Make sure the patch is correct by running it through\r\n    scripts/checkpatch.pl\r\n  - Submit the code to the maintainer of the driver/subsystem, finding\r\n    the proper name and mailing lists to send it to by running the tool,\r\n    scripts/get_maintainer.pl on your patch.\r\n  - Send a web link back to me of your patch in the public mailing list\r\n    archive (don't cc: me on the patch, that will only confuse me and\r\n    everyone in the kernel development community.)\r\n  - If you want to mention the Eudyptula Challenge as the reason for\r\n    writing the patch, feel free to do so in the body of the patch, but\r\n    it's not necessary at all.\r\n\r\nThat's it, much like task 10 was, but this time you are fixing logical\r\nissues, not just pesky coding style issues.  You are a real developer\r\nnow, fixing real bugs!\r\n\r\nThis is Task 17 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAnother patch made and sent in.  See, that wasn't so hard.  Keep sending\r\nin kernel patches outside of this challenge, those lazy kernel\r\ndevelopers need all the help they can get in cleaning up their code.\r\n\r\nIt is time to start putting the different pieces of what we have done in\r\nthe past together, into a much larger module, doing more complex things.\r\nMuch more like what a \"real\" kernel module has to do.\r\n\r\nGo dig up your code from task 06, the misc char device driver, and make\r\nthe following changes:\r\n\r\n - Delete the read function.  You don't need that anymore, so make it a\r\n   write-only misc device and be sure to set the mode of the device to\r\n   be write-only, by anyone.  If you do this right, udev will set up the\r\n   node automatically with the correct permissions.\r\n - Create a wait queue, name it \"wee_wait\".\r\n - In your module init function, create a kernel thread, named of course\r\n   \"eudyptula\".\r\n - The thread's main function should not do anything at this point in\r\n   time, except make sure to shutdown if asked to, and wait on the\r\n   \"wee_wait\" waitqueue.\r\n - In your module exit function, shut down the kernel thread you started\r\n   up.\r\n\r\nLoad and unload the module and \"prove\" that it works properly (that the\r\nthread is created, it can be found in the process list, and that the\r\ndevice node is created with the correct permission value.)  Send in the\r\nproof and the .c file for the module.\r\n\r\nBe sure to keep this code around, as we will be doing more with it next\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 18 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNice job with the kernel thread.  It really doesn't take much code at\r\nall to create a new thread.  So now let us get some data into the module\r\nto give the thread something to do.\r\n\r\nBase all of this work on your task 17 codebase.\r\n\r\nGo back and dig up task 12's source code, the one with the list\r\nhandling.  Copy the structure into this module, and the\r\nidentity_create(), identity_find(), and identity_destroy() functions\r\ninto this module as well.\r\n\r\nWrite a new function, identity_get(), that looks like:\r\n  struct identity identity_get(void);\r\nand returns the next \"identity\" structure that is on the list, and\r\nremoves it from the list.  If nothing is on the list, return NULL.\r\n\r\nThen, hook up the misc char device \"write\" function to do the following:\r\n  - If a write is larger than 19 characters, truncate it at 19.\r\n  - Take the write data and pass it to identity_create() as the string,\r\n    and use an incrementing counter as the \"id\" value.\r\n  - Wake up the \"wee_wait\" queue.\r\n\r\nIn the kernel thread function:\r\n  - If the \"wee_wait\" queue wakes us up, get the next identity in the\r\n    system with a call to identity_get().\r\n  - Sleep (in an interruptable state, don't go increasing the system\r\n    load in a bad way) for 5 seconds.\r\n  - Write out the identity name, and id to the debug kernel log and then\r\n    free the memory.\r\n\r\nWhen the module exits, clean up the whole list by using the functions\r\ngiven, no fair mucking around with the list variables directly.\r\n\r\nYes, it's a bit clunky, but it shows the basics of taking work from\r\nuserspace, and then quickly returning to the user, and then going off\r\nand doing something else with the data and cleaning everything up.  It's\r\na common pattern for a kernel, as it's really all that a kernel ends up\r\ndoing most of the time (get a disk block, write a disk block, handle a\r\nmouse event, etc.)\r\n\r\nLoad and unload the module and \"prove\" that it works properly by writing\r\nand looking at the debug log, and that everything cleans up properly\r\nwhen the module is unloaded.\r\n\r\nSend in the proof and the .c file for the module.\r\n\r\nA good test script would be the following:\r\n        echo \"Alice\" > /dev/eudyptula\r\n        echo \"Bob\" > /dev/eudyptula\r\n        sleep 15\r\n        echo \"Dave\" > /dev/eudyptula\r\n        echo \"Gena\" > /dev/eudyptula\r\n        rmmod task18\r\n\r\nRemoving the module while there is pending work is always a good stress\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 19 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHandling delayed work is easy now, right?  So, time to move on to\r\nsomething totally different.  How about networking?  We have been\r\nignoring that part of the kernel, so let us now focus on the network\r\nside of the kernel, as that is a huge reason for why Linux has taken\r\nover the world.\r\n\r\nFor this task, write a netfilter kernel module that does the following:\r\n  - monitors all IPv4 network traffic that is coming into the machine\r\n  - prints the id to the kernel debug log if the network traffic stream\r\n    contains your id.\r\n  - properly unregisters you from the netfilter core when the module\r\n    unloads.\r\n\r\nTest this by sending yourself an email with your id in the subject, much\r\nlike the email you need to send back to me.\r\n\r\nSend in the proof and the .c file for the module.\r\n\r\nThis is Task 20 of the Eudyptula Challenge\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNetworking filters turned out to be not all that complex in the end,\r\ngreat work with that.\r\n\r\nSo, here's the final task.\r\n\r\nThere might be other tasks that get created and sent out later on, but\r\nthe original challenge had 20 tasks, so after finishing this one, you\r\ncan consider yourself done!\r\n\r\nLet's try something a bit harder.  Something that might cause some data\r\nloss on a filesystem, always a fun thing to play with, if for no other\r\nreason than to not be afraid of things like that in the future.\r\n\r\nThis task requires you to work on the fat filesystem code:\r\n  - Add an ioctl to modify the volume label of a mounted fat filesystem.\r\n    Be sure to handle both 16 and 32 bit fat filesystems {hint!}\r\n  - Provide a userspace .c program to test this new ioctl.\r\n\r\nThat's it!  Seems so simple, right?  I wonder why that option isn't in\r\nthe kernel tree already...\r\n\r\nAnyway, provide a patch to the kernel, and the .c file used to test the\r\nnew ioctl, as well as \"proof\" of this working.  Make sure you don't run\r\ninto 32/64bit kernel issues with the ioctl, if you do things correctly,\r\nyou shouldn't have any problems.\r\n\r\nI recommend doing this work on either a loop-back fat filesystem on your\r\n\"normal\" filesystem, or on a USB stick.  Either will work just as well,\r\nand make things easier to debug and test.\r\n\r\nWatch out for locking issues, as well as dirty filesystem state\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nBest of luck!\r\n\r\n": "Here is a summary of the README content in 2-3 sentences:\n\nThe Eudyptula Challenge consists of 20 tasks that aim to teach kernel programming by modifying and extending existing Linux kernel modules.

This project-based learning journey will take you through the core concepts of kernel programming, starting from scratch and gradually building towards a fully functional multithreaded kernel. Even if you have no previous experience with kernel development, this project will provide you with the knowledge and hands-on experience necessary to create your own OS kernel.\n\n## About This Project\n\nThe project is divided into several key stages, designed to build your skills incrementally:\n\n1. **Real Mode Development**\n2. **Protected Mode Development**\n3. **Bonus: Mastering Assembly Language**\n\nEach section addresses critical aspects of kernel development, from foundational concepts like the boot process to advanced topics like multitasking, memory management, and file system implementation.\n\n### Real Mode Development\n\nThis section introduces the very basics of kernel development. You'll work on:\n\n- Understanding how the boot process works, starting from BIOS to your kernel.\n- Writing a bootloader in assembly language to initialize your kernel.\n- Handling interrupts in real mode to manage low-level operations.\n- Reading a sector (512 bytes) from the hard disk, building up toward a filesystem.\n\n### Protected Mode Development\n\nOnce you're comfortable with the real mode, you'll advance to the **Protected Mode** where modern kernels operate. This stage will cover:\n\n- Implementation of the **FAT16 filesystem** to manage file storage.\n- **Memory management** techniques such as paging and segmentation to handle virtualization.\n- Building a **keyboard driver** to manage user inputs.\n- Creating an **ELF file loader** to load executable files.\n- Designing a **virtual filesystem layer** similar to what is found in the Linux kernel.\n- Implementing **processes and task switching** for multitasking capabilities.\n\n### Assembly Language Bonus\n\nFor those less familiar with assembly language, this bonus section will help you become comfortable with the low-level coding required for kernel development. You'll master critical assembly operations that power the boot process, interrupt handling, and direct hardware interactions.\n\n## Project Objectives\n\nBy the end of this project, you will have built:\n\n- A custom bootloader written in Assembly.\n- A 32-bit multitasking kernel with support for hardware interrupts.\n- A simple file system to load and run applications.\n- Memory management features, including virtual memory.\n- Support for task switching, enabling multitasking in your OS.\n- A keyboard driver and the ability to load ELF binaries.\n\n## Required Skills\n\n- **C programming**: Since kernels are primarily written in C, a solid understanding of the language is crucial.\n- **Assembly Language**: You’ll work closely with Assembly for low-level tasks like writing the bootloader and managing CPU registers.\n\n## Key Learning Outcomes\n\nUpon completing this project, you will have gained expertise in:\n\n- **Kernel development** from scratch, creating the core of an operating system.\n- **Multitasking**: Enabling your kernel to run multiple processes concurrently.\n- **Memory management**: Implementing virtual memory, paging, and memory segmentation.\n- **System calls and interrupts**: Understanding how an OS communicates with hardware and software.\n- **Kernel and user land**: Differentiating between protected kernel space and user space.\n- **Debugging low-level code**: Using GDB to debug your kernel in an emulator.\n- **ELF file handling**: Writing a loader for executing applications in your OS.\n\n## Tools and Technologies\n\n- **NASM/FASM** for assembly language.\n- **QEMU** for emulating your kernel.\n- **GDB** for debugging and inspecting machine code.\n- **GCC** for compiling C code into machine code that runs in your kernel.\n\n## Who Should Undertake This Project?\n\nThis project is ideal for:\n- Students or developers interested in operating system design.\n- Enthusiasts keen on learning how kernels and low-level programming work.\n- Developers who want to explore memory management, multitasking, and system programming.\n\n## Ready to Start?\n\nEmbark on this exciting journey to build a multithreaded kernel from scratch. Along the way, you’ll gain hands-on experience with every layer of an operating system, from bootloading to multitasking and memory management.\n\n---\n\n": "Here is a summary of the project's purpose and key features:\n\nThis GitHub repository provides a comprehensive guide for developing a multithreaded kernel from scratch.

This repository is created to help me track and learn from errors encountered while working with the Linux kernel. By keeping a record of the errors I encounter and the solutions I find, I can enhance my understanding of the kernel and develop troubleshooting skills.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Personal Linux Kernel Error Tracking Repository is designed to be my personal logbook for documenting the errors I encounter while working with the Linux kernel. It serves as a private space for me to reflect on my learning journey, understand and analyze the errors, and experiment with potential solutions.\n\n## Recording Errors\n\nWhen recording errors in my Linux Kernel Error Tracking Repository, I follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Create a new Markdown (.md) file for each error encountered. For example, I can create a file called `device-driver-error.md` to document errors related to device drivers.\n\n2. Open the Markdown file and describe the error in detail. I include any relevant error messages, stack traces, and steps to reproduce the error. Being specific and thorough helps me analyze the issue effectively.\n\n3. If I find a solution or workaround for the error, I document it in the Markdown file. I include the steps I took to resolve the error, any code changes made, or any external resources I referred to.

Clone the repository or download the project files to your Raspberry Pi.\n2. Update the `laptop_ip` in `shared/config.py` to match your laptop’s local IP address (`192.168.137.235`).\n3. Run the robot control program:\n   ```bash\n   python robot/main.py\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## **How It Works**\n\n1. **Raspberry Pi Sensors:**\n   - The Raspberry Pi reads data from the ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to the nearest object.\n   - The Raspberry Pi Camera captures an image of the surroundings.\n\n2. **Communication:**\n   - The Raspberry Pi sends the sensor data (distance and image) to the Flask API running on the laptop via HTTP POST requests.\n   \n3. **Deepseek Processing:**\n   - The Flask API processes the data and queries Deepseek using the sensor information (e.g., distance).\n   - Deepseek responds with a command (e.g., \"move forward,\" \"turn left,\" etc.).\n\n4. **Robot Action:**\n   - The Raspberry Pi receives the command and controls the robot’s movement accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## **File Descriptions**\n\n### **Laptop Side**\n- **`laptop/app.py`**: Runs a Flask API that listens for sensor data from the Raspberry Pi and sends back movement commands based on Deepseek's response.\n- **`laptop/Deepseek_query.py`**: Queries the Deepseek model using the data from the Raspberry Pi and returns a command.\n\n### **Robot Side**\n- **`robot/main.py`**: Main control program for the robot. It sends sensor data (distance and image) to the laptop and executes the commands received.\n- **`robot/camera.py`**: Captures images using the Raspberry Pi Camera.\n- **`robot/ultrasonic.py`**: Reads distance data from the ultrasonic sensor.\n\n### **Shared**\n- **`shared/config.py`**: Configuration file containing settings like the laptop's IP address.\n\n---\n\n## **Usage**\n\n### **On the Laptop:**\n1. Ensure Flask is running:\n   ```bash\n   python laptop/app.py\n   ```\n2. The Flask server will listen on your laptop's IP (`http://192.168.137.235:5000`).\n\n### **On the Raspberry Pi:**\n1. Ensure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the same network as the laptop.\n2. Run the robot control program:\n   ```bash\n   python robot/main.py\n   ```\n\nThe robot will start sending sensor data to the laptop, which will respond with movement commands. The robot will then execute these commands.\n\n---\n\n## **Additional Notes**\n- Ensure that the Raspberry Pi and the laptop are on the same local network.\n- Modify the `move_robot` function in `robot/main.py` to include the actual motor control logic for your robot.\n- You can expand this project by integrating object detection, more sensors, or adding more complex logic to the Flask API and Deepseek processing.\n": "Here is a summary of the GitHub repository README content:\n\nThe Wandering Robot Powered by Deepseek project involves an autonomous robot that moves around based on sensor input from a Raspberry Pi 5, camera, and ultrasonic sensor.

  "Summarize the following GitHub repository README content in 2-3 sentences, focusing on the project's purpose and key features:\n\n# Project Proposal: Open-Source End-to-End Chip Fabrication Simulation\n\n## Motivation and Goals\n\nModern chip design is moving toward openness: public PDKs and EDA tools lower barriers and democratize innovation ([SKY’s the Limit with the SKY130 Open-Source PDK - Skywater Technology](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/sky130-open-source-pdk/#:~:text=Three%20years%20ago%2C%20SkyWater%2C%20Efabless,exciting%20social%20developments%20also%20emerged)) ([Open-source hardware: a growing movement to democratize IC design - Michigan Engineering News](https://news.engin.umich.edu/2023/01/open-source-hardware-a-growing-movement-to-democratize-ic-design/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20benefits%20of,%E2%80%9D)). This project aims to build a fully open-source workflow from raw silicon to running software, blending physics-level fabrication simulation with digital design. Key goals include:\n- **Process Simulation:** Model semiconductor fabrication steps (doping, diffusion, deposition, photolithography, etching) using open-source physics tools (molecular dynamics, TCAD, CFD).  \n- **Custom CPU Design:** Define a new ISA and implement the CPU in RTL (e.g. Verilog/Chisel), using frameworks like LLVM TableGen to specify instructions ([Tools for Learning LLVM TableGen - The LLVM Project Blog](https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2023-12-07-tools-for-learning-llvm-tablegen/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20it%20is%20used,line%20options%2C%20and%20so%20on)).  \n- **Physical Chip Layout:** Synthesize and place-and-route the design with open tools, run DRC/LVS, and generate GDSII, using an open PDK (e.g. SkyWater 130nm) ([SKY’s the Limit with the SKY130 Open-Source PDK - Skywater Technology](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/sky130-open-source-pdk/#:~:text=Three%20years%20ago%2C%20SkyWater%2C%20Efabless,exciting%20social%20developments%20also%20emerged)).  \n- **Simulation & Testing:** Verify RTL and system behavior using open simulators (Icarus Verilog/Verilator for HDL, and an ISA-level emulator) to ensure correctness.  \n- **Toolchain Development:** Build an assembler and compiler for the new ISA using LLVM or GCC backends ([Tools for Learning LLVM TableGen - The LLVM Project Blog](https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2023-12-07-tools-for-learning-llvm-tablegen/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20it%20is%20used,line%20options%2C%20and%20so%20on)).  \n- **Software Integration:** Develop a minimal OS or runtime (e.g. a simple Unix-like kernel such as xv6 ([\n6.1810 / Fall 2024\n](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2024/xv6.html#:~:text=Xv6%20is%20a%20teaching%20operating,1810))) to run on the simulated CPU.  \n\n## Workflow Overview\n\nThe project proceeds in staged phases integrating materials and design. First, a **process simulation** phase will model each fabrication step at the physical level. Next, a **device modeling** sub-phase uses these results to characterize transistors (via open TCAD). Then a **digital design** phase defines the ISA and RTL, followed by a **back-end design** phase for layout. Parallel tracks will build the software stack (assembler, compiler, OS). Milestones at each stage ensure all pieces integrate smoothly.\n\n## Stage 1: Physics-Based Fabrication Modeling\n\nThis stage uses physics simulation to emulate semiconductor manufacturing. TCAD simulators (such as Charon ([Charon – Sandia National Laboratories](https://charon.sandia.gov/#:~:text=Charon%20is%20an%20open,systems%20that%20support%20the%C2%A0MPI%20standard)) or DEVSIM ([GitHub - devsim/devsim: TCAD Semiconductor Device Simulator](https://github.com/devsim/devsim#:~:text=DEVSIM%20))) solve the diffusion equations for implanted dopants and predict transistor I–V characteristics. The dopant profiles from TCAD feed into device models to validate transistor behavior. Film deposition (e.g. chemical vapor deposition) and plasma etching are modeled with continuum tools: for example, the open-source CFD toolkit OpenFOAM can simulate material flow and etching ([SOMAFOAM: An OpenFOAM based solver for continuum ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465521000229#:~:text=SOMAFOAM%3A%20An%20OpenFOAM%20based%20solver,for%20etching%20and%20deposition)).\n\nPhotolithography is modeled with optical simulation: light passing through a mask produces an aerial image on the photoresist. An open-source lithography simulator can compute the diffraction and interference of light from a given mask ([GitHub - quarterwave0/LithographySimulator: A Python-based tool for modeling optical photolithography](https://github.com/quarterwave0/LithographySimulator#:~:text=LithographySimulator%20is%20an%20open,for%20modeling%20optical%20lithography)). \n\n ([GitHub - quarterwave0/LithographySimulator: A Python-based tool for modeling optical photolithography](https://github.com/quarterwave0/LithographySimulator)) *Figure: A simulated aerial image from an open-source lithography tool. The mask pattern (left) produces an intensity distribution (right) on the wafer.* Photolithography simulation requires modeling how light projects the mask pattern onto resist and how photoresist develops. After exposure, resist development and etching can be simulated (e.g. via boolean or level-set methods) to yield final feature shapes. These models together create a step-by-step physics-based simulation of chip fabrication, from silicon bulk to patterned wafer.\n\n## Stage 2: Custom ISA and RTL Design\n\nIn this stage a custom Instruction Set Architecture is specified and implemented in hardware description language. The ISA (registers, opcodes, instruction formats) is defined and documented. Tools like LLVM’s TableGen can be used to describe the new instructions and generate assembler/disassembler support ([Tools for Learning LLVM TableGen - The LLVM Project Blog](https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2023-12-07-tools-for-learning-llvm-tablegen/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20it%20is%20used,line%20options%2C%20and%20so%20on)). The CPU datapath and control logic (pipeline stages, ALU, registers, etc.) are written in Verilog or a similar HDL. This RTL is simulated with open-source tools (Verilator, Icarus Verilog) to verify correctness. Once verified, it will be synthesized to a gate-level netlist using an open-source synthesizer (e.g. Yosys).\n\n## Stage 3: Physical Design (Layout and GDSII)\n\nThe gate-level netlist is then used for full chip layout with open-source EDA tools. A floorplan is created and an automated flow (e.g. the OpenROAD flow ([GitHub - The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts: OpenROAD's scripts implementing an RTL-to-GDS Flow. Documentation at https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts#:~:text=Synthesis%20%3A%20Inputs%20%20,Netlist%2C%20SDC))) is run to perform placement, clock-tree synthesis, and routing. The design uses an open PDK (for example, the SkyWater SKY130 130nm PDK ([SKY’s the Limit with the SKY130 Open-Source PDK - Skywater Technology](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/sky130-open-source-pdk/#:~:text=Three%20years%20ago%2C%20SkyWater%2C%20Efabless,exciting%20social%20developments%20also%20emerged))) to ensure layer definitions and design rules are available. Layout editing tools (Magic or KLayout) perform design-rule checking and layout-vs.-schematic (LVS). Finally, the completed chip design is exported in GDSII format for fabrication or further analysis ([GitHub - The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts: OpenROAD's scripts implementing an RTL-to-GDS Flow. Documentation at https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts#:~:text=%3A%20Global%20Routing%20%3A%20Detailed,KLayout)).\n\n## Stage 4: Simulation and Verification\n\nAt this stage the complete design is thoroughly tested in simulation. Gate-level RTL simulation is performed with open-source Verilog simulators. For example, Icarus Verilog is a free Verilog compiler/simulator ([Icarus Verilog for Windows](https://bleyer.org/icarus/#:~:text=Icarus%20Verilog%20is%20a%20free,under%20the%20GNU%20GPL%20license)) that can run the CPU model. Testbenches feed instruction sequences into the CPU and check that the outputs match expected behavior. A cycle-accurate or instruction-level emulator for the custom ISA can also execute compiled programs to validate system behavior. Any bugs found in simulation lead to corrections in the RTL or verification models.\n\n## Stage 5: Assembler and Compiler Toolchain\n\nA full software toolchain for the new ISA is developed. An assembler translates human-readable assembly into machine code for the CPU. For higher-level language support, an existing compiler framework can be adapted: for example, LLVM can be extended with a custom backend by defining the ISA in TableGen ([Tools for Learning LLVM TableGen - The LLVM Project Blog](https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2023-12-07-tools-for-learning-llvm-tablegen/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20it%20is%20used,line%20options%2C%20and%20so%20on)), or a GCC backend can be created. The toolchain includes a linker and runtime (or libraries) to build executable programs. Generated binaries are then run on the RTL simulator or emulator to test the end-to-end system.\n\n## Stage 6: Minimal Operating System\n\nFinally, a simple operating system or runtime environment is created to run on the CPU. This might begin as a bootloader plus a tiny kernel that provides basic services (memory management, I/O, scheduling). An educational Unix-like kernel (similar to MIT’s xv6 ([\n6.1810 / Fall 2024\n](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2024/xv6.html#:~:text=Xv6%20is%20a%20teaching%20operating,1810))) could serve as a reference. The OS provides system calls (e.g. for console output or basic file I/O) so that user programs can run. Even a minimal OS that, for example, prints to a console or blinks an LED would demonstrate the entire hardware/software stack. The OS is compiled with the new toolchain and tested on the simulated CPU.\n\n## Milestones and Deliverables\n\n- **Process Simulation Prototype:** Demonstrate dopant diffusion and simple deposition/etch simulation for basic test structures.  \n- **Device Model Validation:** Simulate a transistor using the process models and verify that its I–V curves match expectations.  \n- **ISA Definition:** Finalize the custom instruction set architecture and document its encoding.  \n- **RTL CPU Model:** Implement the CPU in HDL and verify it executes instructions correctly.  \n- **Physical Design (GDSII):** Synthesize the netlist, generate a layout (GDSII), and perform DRC/LVS verification.  \n- **Software Toolchain:** Build a working assembler and compiler that produce correct binaries for the CPU.  \n- **OS Boot:** A minimal OS or runtime successfully boots and runs simple programs on the simulated hardware.  \n\n## Recommended Open-Source Tools and Platforms\n\n- **Process Simulation:** LAMMPS (molecular dynamics), OpenFOAM (CFD) [SOMAFOAM: An OpenFOAM based solver for continuum ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465521000229#:~:text=SOMAFOAM%3A%20An%20OpenFOAM%20based%20solver,for%20etching%20and%20deposition), open TCAD (Charon [Charon – Sandia National Laboratories](https://charon.sandia.gov/#:~:text=Charon%20is%20an%20open,systems%20that%20support%20the%C2%A0MPI%20standard), DEVSIM [GitHub - devsim/devsim: TCAD Semiconductor Device Simulator](https://github.com/devsim/devsim#:~:text=DEVSIM%20)), and optical lithography simulators [GitHub - quarterwave0/LithographySimulator: A Python-based tool for modeling optical photolithography](https://github.com/quarterwave0/LithographySimulator#:~:text=LithographySimulator%20is%20an%20open,for%20modeling%20optical%20lithography).  \n- **Hardware Design:** Verilog/VHDL (RTL), Yosys (synthesis) [GitHub - The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts: OpenROAD's scripts implementing an RTL-to-GDS Flow.

I'm **Utkarsh Maurya**, and you’ve just landed in the heart of one of my most ambitious projects: writing a complete operating system from scratch.\n\nThis isn’t just a side project — this is me, going full throttle into the depths of low-level computing. From booting off a raw binary, enabling the A20 line, all the way into protected mode, writing my own interrupt handlers, and doing HDD I/O — everything is custom-built, step by step.\n\nNo frameworks. No shortcuts. Just real, bare-metal coding.\nWant to try it out: go to [myOwnOS-dev-env](https://github.com/pro-utkarshM/myownos-dev-env), this is where you want to start.\n\n---\n\n## What’s This Project About?\n\nI wanted to **understand how computers really work** — not just run code on top of a stack of abstractions, but build the stack *myself*. That meant starting from the boot sector and climbing my way up toward user programs, a file system, multitasking, and more.\n\nThis OS is being built using:\n- **Assembly + C**\n- My dev environment is Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)\n- Tools: `nasm`, `gcc`, `qemu`, `make`, and raw grit\n\n---\n\n## What’s Already Done?\n\n> \"Building my own OS from scratch — user space is up and running.\"\n\nHere’s what’s already been checked off:\n\n- 🔸 Bootloader (boot.asm)\n- 🔸 A20 line enabled\n- 🔸 Protected mode entered (manually, and cleanly)\n- 🔸 Kernel written in C with assembly glue\n- 🔸 Custom `Makefile`, build scripts (`build.sh`, `run_qemu.sh`)\n- 🔸 HDD sector reads working\n- 🔸 BIOS Parameter Block implemented\n- 🔸 Playing around with the interrupt table\n- 🔸 First userland code runs!\n- 🔸 Set up **Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)** fully\n- 🔸 Refine **in/out I/O ops**\n\nEvery commit tells a story — from `\"Big Bang\"` to `\"avg. hello world program..\"` and `\"playing with my interrupt table\"` — this repo is more than just code. It’s a timeline of curiosity and deep dives.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nHere’s what’s still cooking:\n\n- [ ] Implement **Paging**\n- [ ] Setup **TSS (Task State Segment)**\n- [ ] Finalize **IRQ Handling**\n- [ ] Expand **HDD I/O (PIO mode)**\n- [ ] Finish **FAT16 File System + VFS**\n- [ ] Kernel panic screens & graceful error handling\n- [ ] Virtual keyboard input\n- [ ] Run proper **user programs**\n- [ ] Basic shell interface\n- [ ] Implement **multitasking**\n\nI’m giving this project around **2 hours/day** — slow, steady, focused.\nWill try to finish this before 21th of April, 2025\nNo turning back.\n\n---\n\n## Big Thanks\n\nTwo resources have been absolute game-changers:\n- [OSDev.org](https://osdev.org) – the holy grail for OS developers\n- low lEU – super clear explanations for tough concepts\n\nIf you're even thinking of writing your own OS, start there. And then... just start.\n\n---\n\n## Want to Follow or Contribute?\n\nClone the repo, follow along, or just shoot me a message if you’re building something similar. Happy to learn, share, and nerd out together.\n\n**Next up: IDT, paging, and VFS. Let's go.**\n\n— Utkarsh Maurya\n\n---\n": "Here is a summary of the GitHub repository README content in 2-3 sentences, focusing on the project's purpose and key features:\n\nThe project is about building an operating system from scratch using assembly language and C, with no frameworks or shortcuts.
